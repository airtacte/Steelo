## Conclusion ü§ù

Each `.sol` file encapsulates specific business logic related to its domain, allowing for a clean separation of concerns and the ability to upgrade parts of the system without affecting the whole. This modularity and upgradeability are core benefits of the Diamond Standard architecture employed by Steelo.

For developers and contributors looking to understand the full scope and implementation details of these facets, reviewing the Solidity code within each `.sol` file would be the next step. This would offer insight into the specific functions and events that each facet provides, as well as their interactions within the broader Steelo ecosystem.
