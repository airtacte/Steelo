# Diamond Structure in Steelo

## Overview

The Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) introduces a powerful modular architecture for smart contracts, allowing for maximum flexibility in terms of upgrading and adding functionalities over time. This document outlines how the Diamond Standard is implemented in the Steelo project, providing a scalable and upgradeable framework for our blockchain infrastructure.

## Introduction to Diamond Standard

The Diamond Standard proposes a contract architecture that enables a single contract (the Diamond) to exhibit multiple behaviors (facets) and to be upgraded or extended without the need for migration to a new contract. This is achieved through a combination of delegate calls and a flexible storage pattern.

## Key Components

- **Diamond**: The main contract that users and other contracts interact with. It delegates calls to Facets.
- **Facets**: Contracts containing specific functionalities. Facets can be added, replaced, or removed from the Diamond.
- **DiamondCut**: The mechanism to add, replace, or remove facets. It is the only part of the Diamond that cannot be changed, ensuring the integrity of the upgrade mechanism.
- **DiamondLoupe**: Facets for inspecting which facets and functions are available in the Diamond.
- **Facet Storage**: A shared storage pattern used by facets to ensure data continuity and compatibility across upgrades.

## Steelo's Diamond Architecture

### Purpose

In Steelo, the Diamond Standard facilitates the development of a highly adaptable and upgradeable blockchain platform, specifically designed to cater to the evolving needs of creators and communities within the digital landscape.

### Implementation

- **Smart Contract Modularity**: Steelo's smart contract functionality is divided into facets, allowing for focused development and easy updates to specific parts of the system without impacting the overall contract.
- **Upgrade and Customization**: The Diamond architecture enables Steelo to seamlessly introduce new features or optimize existing ones, ensuring the platform remains at the forefront of blockchain technology.
- **Governance Integration**: The upgrade process can be governed by the community through the Steelo Improvement Proposal (SIP) system, leveraging the DiamondCut mechanism for transparent and democratic decision-making.

### Facets in Steelo

1. **Token Management Facet**: Handles the dual-token system, including the SteeloToken and CreatorToken functionalities.
2. **Governance Facet**: Manages the SIP system and governance voting mechanisms.
3. **Transaction Facet**: Facilitates transaction validation, including interactions with Polygon's ZkEVM for efficient and secure processing.
4. **Interoperability Facet**: Ensures seamless integration with other blockchain networks and protocols, enhancing Steelo's reach and functionality.
5. **Storage Facet**: Manages data storage and retrieval, leveraging decentralized solutions like IPFS and Arweave for integrity and efficiency.

## Conclusion

The adoption of the Diamond Standard in Steelo's architecture underscores our commitment to innovation, security, and community governance. By leveraging this flexible and upgradeable framework, Steelo is poised to adapt to the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, ensuring long-term growth and sustainability.
