# Diamond Structure in Steelo

## Overview

The "ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy" is a technical document describing an innovative standard for Ethereum smart contracts. This standard allows a smart contract to exhibit multiple behaviors or functionalities, which are defined in separate smart contracts called facets. This modular approach enables smart contracts to be more flexible, upgradeable, and efficient in terms of gas usage. Essentially, it provides a way to overcome the limitations of contract size and allows for a dynamic system where functionalities can be added, replaced, or removed without deploying a new contract. The standard outlines the architecture, methods for interaction, and management practices for such contracts, making it a pivotal reference for developers looking to implement complex and adaptable systems on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Key Components

- **Diamond**: The main contract that users and other contracts interact with. It delegates calls to Facets.
- **DiamondCut**: The mechanism to add, replace, or remove facets. It is the only part of the Diamond that cannot be changed, ensuring the integrity of the upgrade mechanism.
- **DiamondLoupe**: Facets for inspecting which facets and functions are available in the Diamond.
- **LibDiamond**: A shared storage pattern used by facets to ensure data continuity and compatibility across upgrades.
- **Facets**: Contracts containing specific functionalities. Facets can be added, replaced, or removed from the Diamond.

## Steelo's Diamond Architecture

### Purpose

In Steelo, the Diamond Standard facilitates the development of a highly adaptable and upgradeable blockchain platform, specifically designed to cater to the evolving needs of creators and communities within the digital landscape.

### Implementation

- **Smart Contract Modularity**: Steelo's smart contract functionality is divided into facets, allowing for focused development and easy updates to specific parts of the system without impacting the overall contract.
- **Upgrade and Customization**: The Diamond architecture enables Steelo to seamlessly introduce new features or optimize existing ones, ensuring the platform remains at the forefront of blockchain technology.
- **Governance Integration**: The upgrade process can be governed by the community through the Steelo Improvement Proposal (SIP) system, leveraging the DiamondCut mechanism for transparent and democratic decision-making.
