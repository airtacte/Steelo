// polygonService.js - Handles interactions with the Polygon network for Steelo

// This service would utilize the Polygon SDK and could include methods for bridging assets
// between Ethereum and Polygon, interacting with Polygon's DeFi platforms, and more.
// As the SDK and specific functionalities are not fully detailed in the Steelo documents,
// below is a high-level placeholder for such interactions.

// Placeholder function for interacting with a DeFi platform on Polygon
async function interactWithDeFiOnPolygon(deFiPlatformAddress, action, params) {
